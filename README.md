## Usage
- This website is layed out as a wikipedia/encyclopedia search-engine like site for MCU heroes, designed with a spy-like intellegence aesthetic. CSS is not meant to be permanant, and is made to be eventually changed with JQuery. The CSS with Phase 1 is just a demo of how the website background may look. Almost every image attached has a transparent background for when a JQuery theme is inserted.
